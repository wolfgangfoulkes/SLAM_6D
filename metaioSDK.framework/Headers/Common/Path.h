/**
 * Represents a file system path
 *
 * This class represents a path to a file/directory on the local file system. It can be empty (e.g.
 * can be used to check for invalid/unset path). Unicode path support is built-in. Construction
 * requires the developer to know the input encoding (see fromUTF8/fromFSEncoding). Direct
 * conversion from/to strings is not implemented in order to avoid programming mistakes.
 *
 * Zero bytes / code points inside a path string are not supported, they are treated as end of the
 * path.
 *
 * When using Metaio SDK on Android with Java, this is mapped java.io.File, so you cannot use this
 * class directly.
